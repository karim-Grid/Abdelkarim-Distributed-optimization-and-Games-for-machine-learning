# Introduction:
In this project I accomplished successfully this 3 tasks:
- Implementation from scrach of the algorithm of one dimensionality reduction technique UMAP. 
- Introduction of some intuitions from T-SNE algorithm to the UMAP implementation . 
- Comparison between the original UMAP technique and my new implementation in term of the quality of visualisation of the MNIST dataset in low dimension.
# Dataset:
- MNIST dataset 
# Requirements:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- sklearn.metrics and sklearn.manifold
- time library
# Results:
 The visualisation of the MNIST dataset in low dimension is better with UMAP dimensionality reduction technique than T-SNE .
